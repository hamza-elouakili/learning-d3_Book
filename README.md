## Learning Data Visualization with D3.js, second edition

This repo will contain examples of the book mentioned in the title whilst I am working through the chapters with 
the purpose of mastery of D3. 


```
npm install

npm start

```

!! However you can see the code you have to adjust the index.js file to load the corresponding chapter exercises. 

**Check my other repo SMT Visualisation Library for elaborated examples on using D3 with React to create visualisation elements**
